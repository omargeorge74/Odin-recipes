    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This beef birria ramen is a rich, spicy Mexican beef birria served as a
      Japanese ramen noodle bowl. Topped with fresh cilantro, onion, and a
      squeeze of lime, an unassuming broth delivers intense flavors while tender
      beef and noodles offer satisfying comfort in every bite.

      <li>2 pounds beef chuck roast, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
      <li>2 beef shanks, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        For sauce base, first toast chilies: heat a dry griddle or skillet over
        medium heat. Toast guajillo chilies and chiles de arbol, turning often,
        until fragrant and lightly browned, being careful not to burn them.
        Place chilies in a bowl, cover them with boiling water, and soak until
        reconstituted, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat oil over medium heat in a large pan. Add onion and
        garlic; cook and stir until soft, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook
        until they break down, about 5 minutes. Let the mixture cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place peppercorns, cloves, dried ginger, cumin seeds, thyme, marjoram,
        and oregano in a mortar and grind into a fine mix.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a blender, combine soaked chilies, 1/4 cup of the chile soaking
        liquid, onion-tomato mix, ground spices, chicken bouillon, and apple
        cider vinegar. Blend until smooth. Add a small amount of beef broth if
        needed for blending. Taste sauce; season with salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        To cook meat, place chuck roast, beef shanks, and beef short ribs in a
        large pot and pour the sauce over it. Add enough beef broth to cover
        meat by about 1 inch, then stir to combine. Bring to a boil over high
        heat, then add cinnamon stick, onion, garlic, and bay leaves. Cover, and
        reduce heat to low, and simmer until meat is tender and falling apart,
        about 2 1/2 hours. Remove and discard short rib bones; skim fat from
        surface of broth using a spoon. Reserve fat for another use, such as
        quesabirrias. Taste broth; season with salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add ramen, and cook until
        tender, 7 to 20 minutes, or according to package instructions. Drain;
        divide noodles into bowls.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble the dish, ladle birria and broth over ramen. Top with
        chopped onion and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges.
