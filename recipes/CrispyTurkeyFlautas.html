    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Leftover turkey is great for a turkey sandwich or three, but that gets old
      and that's also where these crispy flautas come in. And don't forget,
      cheese grated in your own kitchen is so much better than the packaged
      grated cheese.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound cooked, shredded turkey</li>
      <li>6 ounces shredded pepper Jack cheese</li>
      <li>⅓ cup chopped green onions</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>24 small white corn tortillas</li>
      <li>1 egg white to seal flautas (Optional)</li>
      <li>¾ cup shredded napa cabbage</li>
      <li>¾ cup guacamole</li>
      <li>¾ cup sour cream</li>
      <li>¾ cup salsa</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix shredded turkey, pepper Jack cheese, green onions, salt and pepper
        together in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wrap stack of tortillas in a paper towel and place in a sealable plastic
        bag. Seal the bag only halfway. Microwave on high until tortillas are
        hot and flexible, about 45 seconds. Keep tortillas warm in the bag as
        you fill the others.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 2 tortillas on a work surface, one about 2 inches off center of
        the first creating a longer partially double tortilla. Spoon about 1/4
        to 1/3 cup turkey mixture in a row just below the center of the long
        side of the tortilla. Paint a bit of egg white along the top edge of the
        tortillas. Bring bottom edge of the tortilla up and over the filling and
        roll rather tightly toward the top edge over the egg white. Set aside
        with the fold on the bottom while you fill the remaining tortillas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 1/4 inch vegetable oil in a saute pan over medium heat. When oil
        is hot, place flautas in oil, seam side down. Press down gently with a
        spatula a couple of seconds to flatten bottoms. Fry in batches until
        flautas are crispy, golden, and heated through, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
        Drain about a minute on paper towels. Serve topped with shredded
        cabbage, guacamole, sour cream, salsa, and chopped cilantro.
